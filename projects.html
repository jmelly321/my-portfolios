<section id="fraud-detection">
    <h2>Fraud Detection Using Random Forest Classifier</h2>
    <img src="fraud.png" alt="Fraud Detection" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    
    <p>
        Built a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions within a large financial dataset using a Random Forest Classifier. This project focused on handling imbalanced data, optimizing model performance, and ensuring real-world applicability for high-volume transaction environments.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
        The goal was to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using detailed features like transaction type, amount, and account balances. Fraudulent cases were rare, so the model required techniques to handle class imbalance while maintaining high precision and recall.
    </p>

    <h3>Responsibilities & Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Applied feature engineering to extract meaningful signals from raw data.</li>
        <li><strong>Class Imbalance Handling:</strong> Used class weighting in the Random Forest model to emphasize rare fraud cases. Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Development:</strong> Trained a Random Forest Classifier using scikit-learn. Tuned hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split) for optimal performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Assessed performance using Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC AUC. Focused on minimizing false negatives (missed fraud) while keeping false positives manageable.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment & Reporting (Optional):</strong> Designed a pipeline for real-time data integration. Created visual dashboards to communicate model performance to stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tools & Libraries</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>scikit-learn • Pandas • NumPy</li>
        <li>imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)</li>
        <li>Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization</li>
        <li>Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Balanced Performance:</strong> Achieved an F1 Score of X% with improved fraud detection through class balancing.</li>
        <li><strong>Production-Ready:</strong> Designed the model for scalability in environments processing millions of transactions daily.</li>
        <li><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong> Delivered interpretable results and deployment strategy for fraud detection systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Enhanced understanding of handling class imbalance and building robust ensemble models for FinTech use cases.</li>
    </ul>

            <img src="hadooplogo.png" alt="Kali Linux">
            <p>Conducted ethical hacking simulations using Kali Linux tools. Simulated Penetration Testing with Kali Linux: Exploring Ethical Hacking Techniques Objective: As part of my ethical hacking and cybersecurity training, I undertook a simulated penetration testing project using Kali Linux—the premier operating system for penetration testers. The goal of the project was to simulate a real-world cyber attack on a vulnerable system within a controlled, ethical framework. This process helped me explore a variety of ethical hacking techniques, including network scanning, vulnerability assessment, system exploitation, and post-exploitation activities. This portfolio entry outlines the penetration testing methodology I followed, the tools I used, and the results I achieved, offering insights into my hands-on experience with Kali Linux and penetration testing. Tools and Skills During this simulated penetration testing project, I utilized several Kali Linux tools and core skills to complete the penetration testing lifecycle: Kali Linux: A Debian-based Linux distribution used by security professionals for penetration testing and ethical hacking. It comes preloaded with numerous security tools. Nmap: A powerful network scanner that is widely used to discover hosts and services on a computer network. Metasploit: An exploitation framework that allows penetration testers to create and execute exploit code against remote systems. Wireshark: A network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect packets in real time, helping to identify vulnerabilities in network communications. Burp Suite: A comprehensive suite for web application security testing that helps identify issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more. Hydra: A popular tool used to perform brute force attacks on various services like SSH, FTP, HTTP, etc. Aircrack-ng: A suite of tools used for wireless network security testing, focusing on WEP and WPA-PSK encryption cracking. John the Ripper: A tool used to crack password hashes through various methods such as dictionary attacks and brute-forcing. </p>
