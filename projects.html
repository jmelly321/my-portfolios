            <h2>Fraud Detection Using Random Forest Classifier</h2>
            <img src="fraud.png" alt="Fraud Detection">
            <p>Built a robust fraud detection system to identify fraudulent transactions in financial datasets.Fraud Detection Using Random Forest Classifier As a Machine Learning Engineer in this project, I was tasked with building a robust fraud detection system to identify fraudulent transactions in a large dataset. The company processes millions of financial transactions daily, and detecting fraudulent transactions is crucial to prevent significant financial losses. In this project, I worked on a dataset that contained various transaction details such as amounts, account balances, and transaction types, along with a label indicating whether each transaction was fraudulent or legitimate. The goal was to preprocess the data, build an accurate fraud detection model using a Random Forest Classifier, and address issues like class imbalance to ensure the model's effectiveness. Key Responsibilities and Tasks: Data Preprocessing: oCleaned and preprocessed the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. I utilized Pandas to fill in missing values where necessary and applied data transformation techniques to ensure the data was ready for model training. oApplied feature engineering to extract meaningful features from the raw data, ensuring that the model had the best possible inputs for identifying patterns related to fraud. Handling Class Imbalance: oSince the dataset was highly imbalanced (fraudulent transactions were much less frequent than legitimate ones), I employed techniques like class weighting within the Random Forest Classifier to give more importance to fraudulent transactions. oAdditionally, I experimented with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples for the minority class, ensuring the model was not biased toward predicting legitimate transactions and improving detection for fraud. Model Development: oI built a Random Forest Classifier using scikit-learn, leveraging multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy and minimize overfitting. The model was trained to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent based on the features in the dataset. oTuned hyperparameters such as the number of trees (n_estimators), maximum depth of trees (max_depth), and the minimum samples required to split an internal node (min_samples_split) to optimize the model’s performance. Model Evaluation: oEvaluated the model using a variety of metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and the Confusion Matrix to measure the model's ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. oDue to the imbalanced nature of the dataset, I paid particular attention to Precision (the accuracy of positive predictions) and Recall (the ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions), ensuring a balanced trade-off between these metrics. oPlotted the ROC Curve and calculated the AUC (Area Under the Curve) to assess the model’s performance in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Model Deployment (if applicable): oCreated a pipeline to integrate the model with real-time transactional data for fraud detection in a production environment. oProvided stakeholders with visual reports and dashboards to track the model's performance in real-time and ensure its effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions as new data is processed. Key Tools and Technologies Used: Python Libraries: oscikit-learn: For building and evaluating the Random Forest Classifier, handling hyperparameter tuning, and calculating evaluation metrics. oPandas & NumPy: For data manipulation, cleaning, and feature engineering. oImbalanced-learn: For implementing SMOTE and handling class imbalance. oMatplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data distributions, model evaluation metrics, and the ROC curve. Jupyter Notebook: oUsed for developing the project, documenting the analysis, and visualizing results in an interactive environment. Key Achievements: Model Accuracy: Developed a Random Forest Classifier that achieved an F1 Score of X%, demonstrating the model's ability to balance precision and recall effectively in detecting fraudulent transactions. Imbalanced Class Handling: Successfully addressed class imbalance through class weighting and SMOTE, leading to improved fraud detection performance and more reliable predictions on unseen data. Real-time Application Potential: Built a robust model capable of processing millions of transactions, making it suitable for deployment in a production environment where real-time fraud detection is critical. Actionable Insights: Delivered clear, actionable insights for stakeholders on how the model could be integrated into existing systems to detect fraud efficiently and effectively. This project enhanced my understanding of handling imbalanced datasets, applying ensemble methods like Random Forest, and fine-tuning machine learning models for real-world applications, especially in the financial technology domain. </p>
