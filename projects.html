<section id="fraud-detection">
    <h2>Fraud Detection Using Random Forest Classifier</h2>
    <img src="fraud.png" alt="Fraud Detection" style="max-width:100%; height:auto;">
    
    <p>
        Built a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions within a large financial dataset using a Random Forest Classifier. This project focused on handling imbalanced data, optimizing model performance, and ensuring real-world applicability for high-volume transaction environments.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
        The goal was to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using detailed features like transaction type, amount, and account balances. Fraudulent cases were rare, so the model required techniques to handle class imbalance while maintaining high precision and recall.
    </p>

    <h3>Responsibilities & Techniques</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Preprocessing:</strong> Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Applied feature engineering to extract meaningful signals from raw data.</li>
        <li><strong>Class Imbalance Handling:</strong> Used class weighting in the Random Forest model to emphasize rare fraud cases. Applied SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Development:</strong> Trained a Random Forest Classifier using scikit-learn. Tuned hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split) for optimal performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Assessed performance using Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC AUC. Focused on minimizing false negatives (missed fraud) while keeping false positives manageable.</li>
        <li><strong>Deployment & Reporting (Optional):</strong> Designed a pipeline for real-time data integration. Created visual dashboards to communicate model performance to stakeholders.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tools & Libraries</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>scikit-learn â€¢ Pandas â€¢ NumPy</li>
        <li>imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)</li>
        <li>Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization</li>
        <li>Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Balanced Performance:</strong> Achieved an F1 Score of X% with improved fraud detection through class balancing.</li>
        <li><strong>Production-Ready:</strong> Designed the model for scalability in environments processing millions of transactions daily.</li>
        <li><strong>Actionable Insights:</strong> Delivered interpretable results and deployment strategy for fraud detection systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-World Impact:</strong> Enhanced understanding of handling class imbalance and building robust ensemble models for FinTech use cases.</li>
    </ul>
